or not you want them to It's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head To a pure synthetic sympathy that infuriates you totally And a quiet lie that makes you want to scream and shout So here I lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun Raining its guiding light upon everyone For a moment's rest you can lean against the banister After running upstairs again and again From wherever they came to fix you in , but Always fair city's finest follow right behind You've got a pretty vision in your head A pencil full of poison lead And a sickened smile illegal in every town So here I lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun Raining its guiding light upon everyone Here I lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun Raining its guiding light upon everyone You say you mean well , you don't know what you mean Fucking oughta stay the hell away from things you know nothing aboutThought you'd be looking for the next in line to love Then ignore , put out , and put away And so you'd soon be leaving me alone like I'm supposed to be Tonight , tomorrow , and every day There's nothing here that you'll miss I can guarantee you this is a cloud of smoke Trying to occupy space What a fucking joke What a fucking joke I waited for a bus to separate the both of us And take me off , far away from you ' Cos my feelings never change a bit I always feel like shit I don't know why , I guess that I just do You once talked to me about love And you painted pictures of a never never land And I could have gone to that place But I didn't understand I didn't understand I didn't understandSomething's happening , don't speak too soon I told the boss off and made my move Got nowhere to go Son of Sam , son of the shining path , the clouded mind The couple killer each and every time I'm not uncomfortable , feeling weird Lonely leered , options disappeared But I know what to do Son of Sam , son of a doctor's touch , a nurse's love Acting under orders from above King for a day Son of Sam , son of the shining path , the clouded mind The couple killer running out of time Shiva opens her arms now to make sure I don't get too far I may talk in my sleep tonight ' cos I don't know what I am I'm a little like you More like Son of SamI had tender feelings that you made hard But it's your heart , not mine , that's scarred So when I go home I'll be happy to go You're just somebody that I used to know You don't need my help anymore It's all now to you , there ain't no before Now that you're big enough to run your own show You're just somebody that I used to know I watched you deal in a dying day And throw a living past away So you can be sure that you're in control You're just somebody that I used to know I know you don't think you did me wrong And I can't stay this mad for long Keeping ahold of what you just let go You're just somebody that I used to knowThe imitation picks you up like a habit Writing in the glow of the TV's static Taking out the trash to the man Give the people something they'd understand A stickman flashing a fine-lined smile Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style Rich man in a poor man's clothes The permanent installment of the daily dose And you tell off when you tell it like it is Your world's no wider than your hatred of his Checking into a small reality Boring like a drug you take too regularly The athlete's laugh , the broken crutch The first true love that folded at the slightest touch Brought down like an old hotel People diggle through rubble for things they can resell Happy holidays , said sick savior The leaving lover that I still favor I won't take your medicine , I don't need a remedy To be everything I'm supposed to be I don't want nobody else I can do it by myself We're meant to be together Now I'm a policeman directing traffic Keeping everything moving , everything static I'm a hitchhiker you'll recognize passing On your way to some everlasting Better sell it while you can Better sell it while you can Better sell it while you can Better sell it while you canI never really had a problem Because of leaving But everything reminds me of her This evening So if I seem a little out of it Sorry Why should I lie ? Everything reminds me of her The spin of the earth impaled the silhouette of the sun on the steeple And I've gotta hear the same sermon all the time now from you people Why are you staring into outer space Crying Just because you came across it And lost it ?

shoved down in her sock Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue Who can't stay away from you Pretty Mary K , take him back to town I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds Up against the wall , crying black and blue Keeps me away from you Pretty words that you whisper , maybe I misunderstood Somebody's not paying attention What they promised and their word isn't good Oh , Mary K , I can see her face Down there in the waves , painted and erased But I know it's just the reflection of the moon A big fake resembling you Gonna go down in the water , fill my mouth up full of sand I'll be waiting , still impatient With my dead imagination while you're with some other man Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room I'm down here by the bay with my arm around the moon But I'll be with you soon , just as soon as I pay I walk across the water with pretty Mary k Walk on water , pretty Mary KThink I'm unkind But people aren't the way you think they are They can't remember all the time What it was you wanted They paint you out in straight silhouette But don't you get the picture yet Why you getting all upset The worst parts almost over Three's such a crowd You ought to tell me what you tell yourself You ever gonna speak it aloud Do I have to guess like everyone else With an iron will to walk the walk And the glass drawn that can't be moved to talk Black eyes always watch the clock The worst parts almost over You let yourself be froze by death You think I'm mean ' cause I call you out You don't know what you're about The worst parts almost over now The worst parts almost over now Now nowI got a choke chain Made out of nigh train To keep your memory down In quicksand from the main man To drown everything out We were out on a joyride Fucked up from insides Always at a dead stall From sticking pins in a miniature man Who can't feel it at all See you later See you later If I see you at all See you later See you later See you later If I see you at all See you later Walk through thick mud Looking for new blood Thinking I heard your name Cruel imagination is still giving me pain Just to find you with your masterminder Running your affairs Saying how you're better now Since it killed all your other cares See you later See you later If I see you at all See you later See you later If I see you at all See you later See you later If I see you at all See you laterYou shouldn't talk to your yourself Well I pictured somebody else Someone that looks like What I look like Would you say that one of your dreams Got in you and ripped out the seams That's what I'd say That's what I'd say He was a sucker for your double dose Motherfucker turned white as a ghost Don't you say hi Don't you say hi With a broken sink for a face And a head that just takes up space He's not half right He's not half right It's already half past And it won't last I was sticking up for my friend When there's nothing much to defend It's a lost fight It's a lost fight Cause when I talk to you on the phone Well it's just like being alone It's not half right It's not half rightTime to kill , wrote a living will And gave it to the man in the moon But I'm gonna get well soon This happy face is watching me die Elevate me to another world All that I can do on my own Is leave well enough alone Leave well enough alone Leave well enough alone Circumstance dropped by Uninvited and demand to be fed But I've already gone to bed There's nothing you can see from inside My spirit arose , and put on my clothes And helped me , disconnecting the phone To leave well enough alone Leave well enough alone Leave well enough alone Time was always a wild animal in a cage First it's all the reaction , now it's all the rage Waking up at a station stop And reality's invading my brain The cop's gonna search the train They'll take away whatever they find But I don't have the thoughts you want Just a memory of love I was shown A vision that turns to stone Leave well enough alone Leave well enough aloneHere if you want me Listening so close From far away I memorized what you ’ ve told me Like a foreigner on holiday I know to smile at confusion And don ’ t forget the soul that smiles on me Dancing on the Highway The broken line that led From you to me Well I ’ ll be at my station all night So come on by if you feel like Still here if you want me Look at what I can do with empty time A lost love that likes to haunt me It ’ s waiting around to meet me when I die Death surrounds , Protects the living This is what you said and I agreed Not to be so unforgiving Just because your soul ’ s On time and free Because I ’ m here if you want me , my love , Dancing on the Highway But your sun still burns me eye Oh why , oh why ?There was a grown man dying from fright So surprised at the things he'd say With a giant fantasy life Runnin ' round on feet of clay Naked except for a perpetual debt That couldn't be stripped away An unrightable wrong that moved him along Closer to division day Spent a long time living with that Never could give it a name And when you don't know what you're looking at It makes it much harder to take Mostly they'd meet when he was asleep And have some sick exchange That stuck him as wrong and moved him along Closer to division day I can't make an exception for a bad Connection That only goes one way Sell out for a song where I don't belong With you on division day The moon stood up on the ridge Looking down where the water shines And a man looking over the bridge Like he done so many times Thinking about how to stay out Out of troubles way And Flying to fall away from you all It's over division day Beautiful division day Thinking about how to stay out Out of troubles way Flying to fall away from you all It's over division day Beautiful division daySomething came from nothing today While I was saying no Don't you knock on my door I can't answer you anymore Absence makes the heart grow fond Staying away from people Was a question before But I can't answer you anymore Stepped to the scene where we'd meet And wrote a song I did everything right for somebody that Does everything wrong So I go from coast to coast Over the Hawthorn Bridge To the one I adore You asked me what I'm looking for But I can't answer you anymore No , I can't answer you anymoreI can wait I can wait I can sit wondering what in world you think about I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out After all the alcohol The pretty words that devolve down to slurs and drunken shouts I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out It's like some wild last frontier You never know what kind of fight's gonna appear That once begun can't be won Started out losing already and go all ten rounds I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out The tired hits that fall below I can't connect , yeah yeah I know I can wait I can wait I can sit wondering what in the world you think about I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it outI've seen you watching Her every time she crosses the floor So won't you just go and talk to The one you really adore I'm getting pretty used to being The one that you always ignore When somebody wants you I've seen it before You're every kind of color There ain't nothing that you won't claim Your ambition and promise And your addiction to fame And everyone's got a dollar Sign after their name When somebody wants you You treat ' em just the same So go on and pick up You don't care what poison you choose And what person you lose It should've been me , yeah Shouldn't it be ?
